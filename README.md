# Message-Encode-Decode

# Python Introduction:
•	Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
•	Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
•	Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping is very quick.
•	Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
•	Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

# Tkinter Introduction:
•	Tkinter was written by Steen Lumholt and Guido Van Rossum, then later revised by Fredrik Lundh.
•	Tkinter is the Python interface to Tk, which is the GUI toolkit for Tcl/Tk.
•	Tkinter is an open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit used by many programming languages to build GUI programs.
•	Tkinter provides us with a variety of common GUI elements which we can further use to build our interface such as buttons, menus and various kinds of entry fields and display areas.
•	Tkinter works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).

# Base64 Introduction:
•	Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data.
•	Base64 is designed to carry data stored in binary format across the channels that only reliably support text content.
•	Base64 is used obfuscate data or to mask it so that it’s not human readable.

# Objectives:
•	To encode and decode messages using a common key.
•	To create GUI (Graphical User Interfaces).
•	To use popular libraries such as Tkinter and Base64.
•	To learn their implementation through the construction of the prototype.
•	To create Python message encryptor and decryptor.
•	To create buttons and call the functions when the buttons were pressed.

# Learning Outcomes:
•	Learnt various techniques employed in the project.
•	Learnt the implementation of Tkinter & Base64.
•	Learnt their implementation through the construction of a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
•	Created a program which will help people to encode and decode their messages in real time.

# Utilities:
Encrypt-Decrypt is a program which enables the user to encrypt and decrypt the messages easily, allows them a secure way to have their messages secure or to decrypt the message easily, etc.
The various app screens and features used in the website are as follows:
•	Encrypt Window: It is the entry point from where one can encrypt their message.
•	Decrypt Window: This window contains the message which will have to be decoded.
•	Function Button: It can encrypt the message using the key and can decrypt the encrypted hash using same key.
